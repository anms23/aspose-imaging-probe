# How to adjust an image

To adjust your image brightness use the method `AdjustBrightness` and set a brightness parameter between -255 and 255 to perform corrections. The same you can do with `AdjustContrast` method to make contrast corrections with parameter settings to a range from -100 and 100. If the image has a color hue, you can make gamma corrections by setting the Red, Green and Blue components coefficient or general gamma coefficient:
