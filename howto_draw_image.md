# How to draw an image

With Aspose.Imaging you can use several methods to draw graphics primitives such as `DrawLine`, `DrawEllipse`, `DrawRectangle`, `DrawArc`, `DrawBezier` and `DrawString`. You need to create a graphic surface for drawing and set up graphic properties. We will create a surface of 100 x 100 pixels with 32 bits per pixel in our example and set the background to yellow color with `Clear` method. Then we can define drawing a tool, for example, a Pen with a Blue color, to draw a dotted line or use SolidBrush for continuous lines with different colors, followed by X,Y coordinates of the start and end points of the lines:
