# Crop an image

You can select between two types of possible cropping: either indicate new image boundaries by shifts from the sides of the image, i.e. 10 px for left, right top and bottom shifts or create a rectangle with the desired size and use it for image cropping. 


## Crop by shifts

The example below makes an image crop by shifts on 10px from each image side:

## Crop by rectangle

In this example, we create a square with a side length of 20 px and then crop this area from the original image.
