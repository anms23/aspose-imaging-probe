# How to edit your photo or image programmatically

## Intro

Just as in the real world, we pay attention to bright images, so in the virtual world, our perception inevitably reacts to a beautiful picture. The more attractive the shop window, the more likely we will go into the store itself; how the more interesting the visual range of a particular site, whether it is an online store or a thematic blog, the higher its traffic. However, the search and integration of engaging pictures is only part of the task facing the author, who forms the visual range of the page. The next, and no less important step is editing
photos and images. Properly edited photos - the same indicator of the quality of the site as its text content, increase website attractiveness, and user conversion rate, creating new business opportunities. Ready to use a program library for photo editing could facilitate the rapid development of new applications and services. 

Editing pictures is a frequent task for developers, researchers and students. Automatic editing of images helps to prepare initial raw photos for further processing. With programmable image processing, you can easily edit many photos at once. Tasks with photo editing are usually repeated and by using an image manipulation library you can significantly improve your performance. This process could be automatically done by using Aspose.Imaging program library. The program library could do massive manipulations with a bunch of files. For example, repeat several operations sequences with images: image resizing, cropping, rotating and applying filters before publication on a website. Another popular case for programable image editing is creating a web service or custom standalone application for particular operations with images such are drawing text on images, removing the background or adjusting image parameters.

In this article, we consider how to use the most demanded operations for image editing with Aspose.Imaging C# library:

- [Resize](#resizing-an-image)
- [Crop](#crop-an-image)
- [Rotate](#rotate)
- Remove background
- Filter
- Merge
- Grayscale
- Dither
- Adjust
- Binarize
- Cartoonify
- Drawning images

Please follow the link to see the table with the list of all supported image formats -> [supported-file-formats](https://docs.aspose.com/imaging/net/supported-file-formats/)

## Resizing an image

Usually, initial images have different sizes and don't suit our demands. Some images could be in high resolution and very large sizes for publication on a website. Also often we need to create a set of images with different sizes: small, medium and extra large for different views, such are thumbnails for preview or detailed views. The Aspose.Imaging library helps you to create a C# application and do this job automatically. The library already has all the necessary tools to edit image size. You just need to indicate what sizes of images you what to finally have, load initial images to the memory cache, apply the resize method and save the resulting image file to a new location.

## Crop an image

Another widely used operation of image editing is image cropping. An image or photo could have unwanted fields on the sides you want to cut off. Also, you may want to crop a dedicated rectangle area of the photo. For example, the interesting area is located on some part of the whole image and you want to cut off only this particular piece. You can execute both types of cropping: crop by shifts and crop by a rectangle by using Aspose.Imaging. In the first case, you indicate the shifts from sides, in the second - the rectangle area to crop.

## Rotate

Original photos may have the wrong orientation due to the photographer taking photo shots with various camera rotations and embedded auto-rotation does not work properly. 



A more detailed description of resize, crop and rotate operations you could find in the official documentation [link](https://docs.aspose.com/imaging/net/crop-rotate-and-resize-images/).
